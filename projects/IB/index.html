    <h2>About the IB program at MNHS</h2>
    <p>Millard North has been an International Baccalaureate School since 2001. This program, whether the Middle Years or Diploma, is to help enrolled students develop as a young adult with a global perspective. Our students, who have gone through Middle Years and/or Diploma Program, are given higher expectations than most students to encourage them to take the initiative and excel. We have had many students graduate and then attend prestigious or Ivy League universities around the nation. Learning, studying, and innovating in a diverse community as one cohesive unit has allowed our students to develop a strong sense of camaraderie as well as a more open view to the world.</p>

    <h2>The International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme</h2>
    <p>In March 2007, Millard North High School became an authorised International Baccalaureate – Middle Years Programme School. The Middle Years Programme (MYP) provides a framework of academic challenge for students aged between 11 to 16 years. The program is devised to help students develop the knowledge, attitude, and skills to participate actively and responsibly in a changing and increasingly interrelated world. It includes problem solving and analysis which leads to critical thinking. The MYP is designed to teach students to become independent learners who can recognise relationships between school subjects and the world outside.</p>
    <p>MYP is a two-year program at the high school in which students must enter at the 9th grade level and continue through the 10th grade. It is not necessary for a student to participate in the middle school MYP program that was implemented at Millard North Middle School. Also, enrollment in MYP is not required in order to enroll in the 11th and 12th grade IB Diploma Program. The MYP is one of several paths to the IB Diploma Program or to Advanced Placement (AP) classes.</p>
    <h2>International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) - Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>"The International Baccalaureate Organisation aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect. To this end the IBO works with schools, governments, and international organisations to develop challenging programmes of international education and rigorous assessment. These programmes encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate, and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right."</p>
    <h2>MYP Fundamental Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Holistic Education</h3>
    <p>The Areas of Interaction focus on developing links between the disciplines, so that students will learn to see knowledge as an interrelated whole. Students will realise that most real-world problems require insights gained from a variety of disciplines.</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Organise events and activities that promote cross-curricular links through the Areas of Interaction</li>
        <li type="circle">Develop skills to view knowledge from varying points of view</li>
        <li type="circle">Develop Areas of Interaction within and across the disciplines</li>
        <li type="circle">Provide vertical and horizontal articulation within subject areas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Intercultural Awareness</h3>
    <p>The Middle Years Programme focuses on developing students’ attitudes, knowledge and skills as they learn about their own and others’ social, national, and ethnic cultures. Through intercultural awareness, students will learn to foster tolerance and respect of others through empathy and understanding.</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Organise cultural activities</li>
        <li type="circle">Adopt school policies</li>
        <li type="circle">Incorporate a global perspective in curriculum</li>
        <li type="circle">Develop an understanding of one’s own culture</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>The Middle Years Programme supports student’s understanding by providing opportunities of reflection and expression. Language acquisition is crucial for maintaining cultural identity, personal development, and intercultural understanding.</p>
    <ul>

    <h3>Areas of Interaction</h3>
    <p>In order to awaken the intelligence of students and teach them to connect school subjects with the world outside, the Middle Years Programme is based upon five overarching themes. These themes are called the Areas of Interaction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Approaches to Learning</li>
        <li type="circle">Environments</li>
        <li type="circle">Human Ingenuity</li>
        <li type="circle">Health and Social Education</li>
        <li type="circle">Community and Service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are not extra subjects. These themes are the central components used to connect all eight subjects of the Middle Years Programme.</p>
    <h3>Approaches to Learning</h3>
    <p>Students take increasing responsibility for their learning and will produce quality work, increase their self-discipline, develop the capacity for problem-solving and decision-making.</p>
    <h3>Environments</h3>
    <p>Students become aware of their interdependence with the world and are encouraged to develop responsible and positive attitudestowards the environment.</p>

    <h3>Personal Project</h3>
    <p>The personal project is a significant body of work produced over an extended period of time. It is the student’s personal initiative and realisation of a project which reflects the concerns of the Middle Years Programme.  The personal project holds a very important place in the student’s experience of the Middle Years Programme.</p>
    <p>IBO places great importance on the appreciation of the student’s entire personality and potential is measured be means of a personal project. It is designed to assess his/her ability to organize and create. The Areas of Interaction are central to the experience of the personal project which is intended to be the culmination of the student’s involvement with the five areas.</p>
    <h3>Form of the Personal Project</h3>
    <p>The student is encouraged to select a topic to which he/she is committed and about which he/she is enthusiastic. It mustnot be a part of any assessed coursework.</p>
    <p>The personal project may take the form of:</p>
