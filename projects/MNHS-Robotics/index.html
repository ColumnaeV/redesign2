    <h1>DESIGN</h1>
    <h2>Drivetrain</h2>
    <p>We decided to go with the H drive because this year the holonomic drive is going to be not as effective as in past years. The drive would have problems going over the bar to get to the 20 point zone.  We need to make our drivetrain with the ability to get over the bar easily.  With this in mind we added a chain loop in between the wheels.  This chain is not to connect the two wheels as it is help the robot get over the bar.  When the front two wheels go over the bar, and not be able to touch it anymore, the chain will still be touching the bar with enough pressure to act the same as tank treads.  The chain will still move the robot even when the wheels aren’t touching.  And with this method we won’t have to sacrifice the downfalls of tank treads (low mobility, high friction, and they catch on more things than normal).</p>
    <h2>Lift / Scoring</h2>
    <p>This year we have two main ideas: a reverse four bar and 6 bar lift.  The 6 bar lift would be easier to build but not as effective as the reverse four bar lift.  The reverse four bar lift is the better lift because it will extend up more that up and out (which is what the 6 bar does).  Both of the real sketches are in this folder but we put smaller versions here--->.  We as a group have decided to try the reverse four bar lift unless it doesn’t get done in time in which case we will build the 6 bar lift for competition. </p>
    <h2>Autonomous Goals</h2>
    <p>In the autonomous this year we have two goals: score as many points as possible and to set ourselves up to be able to score fast in the main round. As for setting ourselves up we want to stack a few cones on a mobile goal so we can easily score it come the driver control period.</p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>Currently we are using robotc as our ide for compiling and downloading our code to the robot. We have a autonomous selection program the make use of our lcd screen in order for us to make rapid changes of the currently selected autonomous code. We have also made a function that takes a the normal normal voltage per second graph and alters the amount of time that it would take in order for the motors to reach full rotational speed. This is know as a slew rate. Simply it makes the motor accelerate at a slower rate at the beginning and end of the movement to prevent jerking of the motors. We have also used the lcd screen during the drive period to display  a debug array, so that we can determine the reason why we had a failure or a loose in drive or lift control or any number of different factors.</p>

        <p>I have been on the Millard North High School Robotics team for two years going onto my third year, in addition to the Buffett Magnet Middle School Robotics team for two years. I have also helped out with Middle School Robotics hosted at the Millard Public Library for team 13598A where I guided and mentored young engineers all the way to state where they placed second out of thirty-three highly skilled teams. In my first year in high school, I was on team 5069Y then I transitioned to 5069A for my junior year. For my final year in robotics I joined 5069B. I have been to the state and national tournaments three times each. I have attended the US Open two times in my robotics career. I hope to return to the state and national tournaments, and my goal is to inspire and pass on knowledge to some of the new teams at Millard North.</p>

        <p>I am a junior at Millard North High School, and this is my second year in association with the robotics program. In my first year of robotics, I was placed on team 5069D where I spent time trying to build a secondary robot and write its program. Through that year, I gained a lot of experience writing programs for robots and being in a competitive atmosphere. This year, I plan on using my programming skills to write a well-refined control program for the driving period and a carefully designed program to maximize scoring and gaining a significant advantage during the autonomous period.</p>

        <h3>Design and Construction Specialist</h3>
        <p>I am currently a senior and in my third year of participating in Millard North Robotics. I started in my sophomore year on team 5069Y as an assistant engineer. I learned the basics of building with VEX parts whilst also building individual mechanisms of the robot. I gradually took on more responsibilities, including some driver skills and designing a ratchet system that, in essence, doubled the amount of motors. I spent my second year helping a team of freshman, 5069A, learn about robotics. This year I am a member of 5069B with other experienced friends. I hope with our experience combined our team can have a successful year.</p>

        <h2>Christian Nguyen</h2>
        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
        <p>This is currently my senior at Millard North High School and second year in robotics. In my first year of robotics, I was brought into team 5069B as a construction specialist in wiring and developing a complete and competitive ready secondary robot for the team. Throughout that year, I learned many new skills in how to build the structure and mechanics of a robot with less materials and a more efficient design for better gameplay. In this year’s game “In The Zone” on team 5069B, I plan on incorporating similar techniques to team’s primary robot. With a great team roster this year, I have high expectations for the advancement in quality gameplay for competitive matches.
	    Some other activities that I devote myself to outside of the robotics room is web development. Being interested in web development, I took one course in junior high school and absolutely love it. Everyday, I focus my attention on a task and code for at least an hour to complete a task to any project I run across. Through many years of experience, my skill set in web development has led me to create this digital documentation website for Millard North robotics team 5069B.</p>

    <h1>WEB DEV SECTION</h1>
    <h2>The Development</h2>
    <p>This website was developed in order to demonstrate the capability of a group of students on a Millard North robotics team to create a digital documentation method for their robot. The students at Millard North are held to the standards to display a student’s ingenuity and creativity through any type of medium without the support of professional help or pre-built templates such as wix or google sites. With that being said, we have taken it upon ourselves to design, construct, and host our own website.</p>
    <p>Over the period of a couple of months, this project has gone through four main builds as well as a multitude of version updates and alpha renditions. In the very beginning of this project, the leading factor to the development of this was to only be used as the notebook for the robot’s construction progression. The initial intention was to find an easier and more eco-friendly method to present our data while visually pleasing to the judges. This idea was taken from a Millard North team from a couple of years that found it to be a success. From then on, I began to write more code to support other ideas that led to dead ends. Within the course of two months, the project had went through two complete, dead-end builds and onto the third build. With too many changes happening within one version update, the third build was eventually scrapped and downsized for the fourth and current build.</p>
    <p>In this current build, I drew from previous projects and builds and optimised each section to its best ability and functionality to the user. Written to be supported on all desktop mobile viewports, accessible navigation, ease on eyes for any time of the day with light and dark modes, and quality design are the main highlights in which makes this website superior to pre-templated websites.</p>
    <p>Along with that we have created the infrastructure for which our website is being hosted from. To understand how the back end of the website was made, you first have to understand how a website server works. First of the there are many different types of transmission control protocols out there but for a web server only HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 is needed. HTTP stands for hypertext transmission protocol which in laymans terms means it transfers a HTML based website from the server to the client using get and post request. HTTPS (which is what our website is using) on the other hand is HTTP with a secure sockets layer which authenticates you with the server to keep the data transfer encrypted.</p>
    <p>Now that you know the different types we can move on to our website server. We are using a Windows based website server using Internet Information Services (IIS). This a graphic user interface based server which makes rapid changes to the server fast and simple. To start out we pointed our server to our local copy of the website. This is the server to know what file is needed for the website. Next, we move on to changing the default documentation page to have index.html first as it is the home page on our website. From there we bounded our ip to the domain name which is www.mnhsrobotics.com on port 80 and 443. Next we configured the URL rewrite feature to rewrite our HTTP requests to HTTPS requests. This is why even when you type in http://www.mnhsrobotics.com it redirects to https://www.mnhsrobotics.com. Finally we had to buy and point our domain name to the server's IP address. </p>
